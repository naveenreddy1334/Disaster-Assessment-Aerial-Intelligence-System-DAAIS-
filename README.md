# Disaster Assessment Aerial Intelligence System (DAAIS)

A smart and efficient aerial intelligence system designed for rapid disaster assessment using drone imagery and computer vision. This project utilizes deep learning and geospatial analysis to detect and classify disaster-impacted areas, enabling timely responses and resource allocation.

## 🌍 Project Overview

Disaster Assessment Aerial Intelligence System (DAAIS) aims to:

- Automate the detection of disaster zones from aerial/drone images.
- Classify the severity of damage using machine learning.
- Provide visual and geospatial insights for emergency response teams.
- Improve speed and accuracy of disaster assessments.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Disaster Detection** – Identify damaged zones from aerial imagery.
- 🧠 **Deep Learning Models** – Trained neural networks for classification.
- 🗺️ **Geospatial Mapping** – Visualize affected areas on interactive maps.
- 📊 **Dashboard Interface** – User-friendly interface to view results.
- 🛠️ **Modular Design** – Easily extendable and adaptable system.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- OpenCV
- Flask / Django (Web Backend)
- Leaflet / Mapbox / Folium (Geospatial Visualization)
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (Frontend)
